However, through the use of the Content-Disposition HTTP header, websites can override this behavior and force the browser to handle the content externally, even if the browser is capable of displaying the content and even if that is not what the user wanted. By altering the disposition type of Content-Disposition response headers from attachment to inline, InlineDisposition restores user choice.\n\nThis does not mean that all content will be displayed inline in the browser: InlineDisposition simply restores the default behavior, so the browser will still save or externally open a file if it cannot view it or if the user requests that it be saved or externally opened. Only server-initiated saves are affected, and the user can still save a file at the user's own discretion.\n\nInlineDisposition was created in response to my encounters with some websites that forced me to save documents and images that I would rather have viewed directly in the browser. I wanted to control when a file is saved and not have that be dictated to me by a website.\n\nYou can test InlineDisposition by opening this link.\n\nNote: The server can still deny inline viewing of content by specifying a Content-Type that the browser cannot internally handle.","developerComments":null,"eula":null,"homepageURL":"http://code.kliu.org/misc/inlinedisposition/","learnmoreURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/inlinedisposition/?src=api","supportURL":"http://code.kliu.org/tracker/","averageRating":5,"reviewCount":25,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/inlinedisposition/reviews/?src=api","totalDownloads":24339,"weeklyDownloads":176,"dailyUsers":3613,"sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/117973/inlinedisposition-1.0.2.4-sm+fx.xpi?src=api","repositoryStatus":4,"size":3072,"updateDate":1303330641000,"isPlatformCompatible":true},{"id":"pl@dictionaries.addons.mozilla.org","icons":{"32":null,"64":null},"type":"dictionary","name":"Polish Spellchecker Dictionary","version":"1.0.20110621","creator":{"name":"marcoos","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/marcoos/?src=api"},"description":"Polish spell-check dictionary for Firefox 2.0/3.0pre, Thunderbird 2.0/3.0a1 and SeaMonkey 1.1/2.0a1...","fullDescription":"Polish spell-check dictionary for Firefox 2.0/3.0pre, Thunderbird 2.0/30a1 and SeaMonkey 1.1/2.0a1...","developerComments":"This is a Polish dictionary for Firefox & Thunderbird's spell checker, based on SJP.pl's dictionary (by Marek Futrega et al.).\n\nSJP.pl's dictionary itself is available at: http://www.sjp.pl/","eula":"This dictionary for spell-checking Polish texts is licensed under GPL 2.0, LGPL 2.0 and MPL 1.1 (Mozilla Public License).

(accessible also from the context-menu mentioned below.)\n    There is a Context-Menu (mouse secondary-button-click) accesible from Fx main button, Max,Min&Close buttons and Drag-Window control, for opening Options dialog.\n    Works and looks good with ChromiFox basic theme, and also with ChromiFox Extreme, Cfx Extreme CARBON, Strata40/StrataBuddy.

Also, this problem don't affect you if \"Show Firefox 4+ Titlebar\" is setted to \"enabled\" (of course losing some space).\n\n        I've filed Firefox Bug 730219 on 2012-02-24 about this.\n        This is discussed already in the Support Site, Issue 178.\n\n\n\n\n    --> Bug/Issue reports are welcomed in the Support site. Please don't post them in a Review here. (Also, please don't report download errors, they are not caused by the addon, but by one of the many download mirrors of this site.)\n\n    I's recommended (and very easy) to test any issue by opening a new Firefox window with a blank (fresh) profile! (You can leave open the main Firefox window, that wont be affected at all). Very useful to identify addons incompatibilities.\n\n    Simply run this command:\n      firefox.exe -no-remote -profile \"c:\\_Firefox_temp_profile\"\n\n        Having another Fx window with a fresh profile can also be useful to try at will this and other addons without interfering with your main Fx window. (Just in case, more info here: \"Opening New instance of Firefox with another profile\" )\n\n\n    (Please note that in Mac OSX there are mixed reports about hiding the caption)\n\n    Check the Development Channel below for a possible newer version with last fixes!
